# Firefox

I haven't figured out how to install these customizations yet, as I don't think it will be as simple as a link under `.config` and I'm still supporting both Linux and Darwin (MacOS) here since I run Firefox on my work Mac.

For now, I'm manually symlinked them into place with the following commands.

```bash
ln -s "$HOME/backpack/firefox/userChrome.css" "/Users/benjamin-webb/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/2t71y1q8.benjaminedwardwebb/chrome/userChrome.css"
```
