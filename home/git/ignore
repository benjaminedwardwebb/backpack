# I use nix and direnv to manage project-specific development environments. This usually
# involves adding `shell.nix` and `.envrc` files to a project. I ignore these
# files by default, since often I will be the only person to use these files
# for given project. However, they can be manually checked into a repository
# with the following command.
#
# 	git add --force shell.nix .envrc
#
# See: https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell
# See: man git add
