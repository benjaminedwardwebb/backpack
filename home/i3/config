# i3/config
# This is my i3 configuration.
#
# It's structured into the following files.
#
#   - config
# 	- theme(.variant)
#   - style
#   - workspace
#   - window
#   - launcher
#   - bar
#   - start
#
# The order is important and is the order in which the files should be loaded
# by nix.
#
# Global variables are defined in this top-level config file, with the
# exception of theme color variables which are defined in the theme file. This
# is so that these color variables can be defined globally, for all subsequent
# files, but still be isolated from other configuration so that the theme file
# can be changed and the theme update without affecting any other
# configuration. After the theme file other configuration files that deal with
# more specific components of the i3 window manager, like workspaces, the bar,
# or which applications to launch on start, are loaded.
#
# See: https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html

# The following line forces the new v4 configuration format to be used.
# i3 config file (v4)

# Set the modifier key to Mod4.
#
# Mod4 is the Super (Windows) key on Berrio (a Dell Precision 5510).

bindsym $mod+shift+r restart

# Exit i3 (logs you out of your X session).

# Define names for default workspaces for which we configure key bindings
# later on.
#
# These are set here as global variables because they are used in multiple
# other files (e.g., both workspaces.conf and start.conf).
#
# Multiple variables are defines to reference the same workspace, so that we
# can reference a workspace either by its function or its number in other
# configuration. The mapping between function and number is defined once here.
# The names used for the two variables referencing the same workspace must
# match exactly.
