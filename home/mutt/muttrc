# muttrc
# This is my mutt configuration.
#
# It is split into multiple files:
#
#   - muttrc: miscellaneous mutt settings
#   - bind: keybinding configuration
#   - color: color configuration
#   - accounts: configuration managing multiple email accounts
#   - account.<email>: configuration for specific email account <email>
# 
# These files get concatenated into a single muttrc file by nix code. If I
# weren't using NixOS or Home Manager, this muttrc would source the other
# configuration files.
#
# See: http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/
